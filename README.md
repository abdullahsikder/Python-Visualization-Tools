# Python-Visualization-Tools
Here are some scripts that demonstrate some powerful tools that can be done using VTK. Most of these have applications primarily in medical fields, and work specially with combined Poly Data and Image Data. 

VolumeToMesh.py is a tool that converts an Image Data to Poly Data using Marching Cubes algorithm. 
Note: The high opacity is needed for both displaying the Image Data, and for the Marching Cube Algorithm.
